STL Decompose
=============

This is a relatively naive Python implementation of the "Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess" time series decomposition ("STL decomposition," Cleveland et al. 1990 [`pdf <https://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf>`_]).  

This implementation is a variation of (and takes inspiration from) the current implementation of the ``seasonal_decompose`` method `in statsmodels <http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html#statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose>`_. In this implementation, the trend component is calculated by substituting a configurable `Loess regression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression>`_ for the convolutional method used in ``seasonal_decompose``. It also extends the existing ``DecomposeResult`` from ``statsmodels`` to allow for forecasting based on the calculated decomposition. 


Usage
-----

The ``stldecompose`` package is relatively lightweight. It uses ``pandas.Dataframe`` for inputs and outputs, and exposes only a couple of primary methods - ``decompose()`` and ``forecast()`` - as well as a handful of built-in forecasting functions. 

See `the included IPython notebook <https://github.com/jrmontag/STLDecompose/blob/master/STL%20usage%20example.ipynb>`_ for more details and usage examples.


Installation
------------

A Python 3 virtual environment is recommended.

The preferred method of installation is via ``pip``:

``(env) $ pip install stldecompose``

If you'd like the bleeding-edge version, you can also install from this Github repo::
 
    (env) $ git clone git@github.com:jrmontag/STLDecompose.git 
    (env) $ cd STLDecompose; pip install .
