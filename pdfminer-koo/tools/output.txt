Abstract:  Service  restoration  of  a  distribution 
system  is  investigated  by  using  artificial  intelli- 
gence.  The  purpose  is  to  reach  a  proper  resto- 
ration plan for the unfaulted zone after a fault has 
been  identified  and  isolated.  To  reduce  outage 
period  and  improve  service reliability,  the  resto- 
ration plan must be devised in a very short period. 
In the paper, two approaches using artificial intel- 
ligence,  i.e.  the  artificial  neural  network  (ANN) 
approach and the pattern  recognition method, are 
developed  to determine  the restoration  plan  in  a 
very eficient manner. The effectiveness of  the pro- 
posed  approaches  is  demonstrated  by  the  resto- 
ration  of  electricity service following a  fault  in  a 
distribution  system  in  Taipei,  Taiwan.  It  is  con- 
cluded from the example that a proper restoration 
plan can be reached very efficiently using the pro- 
posed  approaches.  Therefore,  it  can  be  used  by 
distribution  system  operators  to  reach  a  resto- 
ration plan. 

Introduction 

1 
Fault  location  identification  [l-41  and  service  resto- 
ration [5-131  are important  functions in the operation of 
a  distribution system. After a fault event takes place, the 
interruption  duration  and  the  number  of  customers 
affected depend  heavily  on  the  effectiveness of  the  fault 
location  identification  algorithm  and  service restoration 
algorithm.  Service reliability can be enhanced  if  the fault 
location  is  identified  accurately  and  efficiently  and  a 
proper  service  restoration  plan  is  reached  in  a  short 
period  after  the fault has  been isolated. How  to devise a 
proper  service restoration  plan  in  an efficient manner  is 
of major concern in this paper. 

Since there are a great number of feeders, laterals, and 
switches in  a  typical  distribution  system, it  may  take  a 
long time to determine the set of  switches which must  be 
operated in  order  to restore  the electricity service in the 
out-of-service area  if  one  tries  to  use  one  of  the  opti- 
misation  techniques.  Past  experience and heuristic  rules 
have  been  widely  employed  by  the  operators  at  many 
utilities  including  Taiwan  Power  Company  (TPC)  in 
order  to  reach  a  suboptimal  solution  in  a  short  period.

Rule-based expert  systems and heuristic-based computer 
programs have been developed [5-131  to incorporate the 
human  experts’ experience  into  the  computer  codes  of 
service restoration. 

In  recent  work  completed  by  the  authors  [SI,  a 
heuristic-based computer program  has been developed to 
reach  a  restoration  plan  for  the  distribution  system  of 
TPC. It is concluded from the results in Reference 5  that 
a restoration  plan  which is able to restore as much  load 
as possible by  operating  a  minimal  number  of  switches 
can be derived in an efficient manner.  In a typical run, it 
takes about 2 minutes to execute the program in order to 
obtain the restoration plan. 

The  above-mentioned  rule-based  expert  systems  or 
heuristic-based codes are widely used techniques in artifi- 
cial intelligence (AI),  and  have  demonstrated  many  suc- 
cessful applications  in  the  area  of  power  systems. With 
the  rapid  developments  in  the  field  of  artificial  intelli- 
gence in recent years, a  great  number  of  new  techniques 
have  been  reported.  Among  them,  artificial  neural  net- 
works  (ANN)  [14-181  and  pattern  recognition  methods 
[19-231  have received considerable attention from power 
engineers. The  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  examine  the 
feasibility of  applying  ANN and the pattern recognition 
method to reach a proper restoration plan. 

To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed 
ANN approach  and pattern  recognition  method,  service 
restoration  following  a  fault  on  a  distribution  system 
within  the  service area  of  Taipei  City  District  Office  of 
Taiwan  Power  Company  is investigated. It is concluded 
from the test results that a proper restoration plan can be 
reached  by  the  proposed  ANN  approach  and  pattern 
recognition  method  in  a  very  short  period.  In  fact, the 
required CPU time is much shorter than that required by 
the heuristic approach of  Reference 5.

number  of  troubleshooters  be  dispatched  to  the  proper 
locations  to  operate  switches  such  that  the  electricity 
service can  be  restored  by  the  supporting  feeder (SU73)

It  is  observed  that  feeder SM64 is  connected  with  a 
supporting  feeder SU73 through  a  normally  open  feeder 
tie switch SW9 which  is a  load  break  switch (LBS). The 
supporting  feeder  SU73  can  be  employed  to  supply 
power  to  feeder  SM64  in  case  of  an  outage  event  on 
SM64 as long  as it  has  enough  spare capacity.  In  addi- 
tion, each of the eight laterals (LATl-LATI)  is connected 
with  a  supporting  lateral  which  can  also  be  used  to 
restore  the  load  of  a  lateral.  Of  course,  there  may  exist 
some  laterals  (LAT9,  LATIO,  LATll  and  LATl2) 
without  supporting  laterals.  It  is  noted  that  we  have  to 
operate  one  switch  (the  feeder  tie  switch)  in  order  to 
restore  electricity service by  using the supporting  feeder. 
On the other hand, we need to operate two switches if  we 
want to restore the electricity service on a lateral from its 
supporting lateral. For example, after the fault at point A 
on  feeder SM64 has  been  isolated,  the  electricity service 
to  customers  on  the  twelve  laterals  LAT1-LAT12  is 
interrupted. To restore the electricity service to the twelve 
laterals,  the  operators  can  use  the  supporting  feeder 
SU73 by  closing  the  feeder  tie  switch  SW9. If  the  sup- 
porting  feeder  does  not  have  enough  spare  capacity  to 
supply  power  to  the  twelve  laterals  LAT1-LAT12,  the 
operators must select some additional supporting laterals 
to help restore  electricity service. For example, we  need 
to open the switch SWlO at branching  point  7 and close 
switch  SW1  (LBS) if  we  want  to  restore  the  electricity 
service  on  lateral  LATl  by  using  its  supporting  lateral 
LAT13. To avoid  undesirable  transient  outage,  we  need 
to close switch SWl  before opening  switch SW10. Since 
the  opening  of  switch  SWlO and  the  closing  of  switch 
SW1  must  be  conducted  at  the  same  time,  the  two 
switches  are  referred  to  as  the  switch  pair  related  to 
service restoration  of  lateral  LATl. It is obvious that we 
need to operate a pair  of  switches when we  try to restore 
the electricity service on a lateral by  using its supporting 
lateral. 

Since  feeder  automation  projects  at  TPC  are  still 
under  way,  the  switches  must  be  operated  manually. 
Therefore,  the  operator  faces  the  problem  of  how  to 
restore  the  electricity  service  to  the  twelve  laterals  as 

252 

and  the  supporting  laterals  LAT13,  LAT14,  LAT15, 
LAT16, LAT17, LATH, LAT19 and LATZO? 

It is obvious that there are numerous solutions to the 
problem. Among these, a feasible restoration  plan  which 
meets all the  six  requirements  described below  [5] must 
be selected. 

(1) The  restoration  plan  must  be  reached  in  a  very 

(2) Restore as much load as possible within the out-of- 

short time. 

service area. 

(3) The required number of switching operations in the 
restoration  plan  should  be  minimal.  This  is  due  to 
reasons related  to limited troubleshooters and life expec- 
tancy of switches [SI. 

(4) Only  the  switches which  are  close  to  the  out-of- 

service area may be operated. 

(5) Radial system structure must be retained. 
(6) No  feeders or  laterals  are  overloaded.  Therefore, 
only those  supporting laterals  with enough  spare capac- 
ities can be employed to restore  the loads of  their corre- 
sponding laterals. 

In  Reference  5,  a  heuristic  search  algorithm  was  devel- 
oped  to devise a  proper  restoration  plan  based  on  the 
operators’  heuristic  rules.  Test  results  indicated  that 
proper  restoration plans could  be reached  by  the heuris- 
tic  search  method  in  a  short time.  In  fact, the  required 
CPU time on a personal computer was about 2 minutes. 
In the present  work,  new  approaches  based  on  artifi- 
cial neural  network  and pattern  recognition  method  are 
developed  to  reach  the  restoration  plan.  In  general, an 
artificial neural network is made up of neurons connected 
together  via  links.  A  special  feature  of  an  ANN  is  its 
capability  to solve a complicated problem very efficiently 
because the  knowledge about the problem  is distributed 
in  the  neurons  and  the  connection  weights  of  links 
between neurons and information are processed in paral- 
lel. Therefore, it is expected that the ANN approach  will 
yield  the  desired  restoration  plan  in  a  more  efficient 
manner  than  the  heuristic  search  approach  in  Refer- 
ence 5.

Design of the artificial neural network 

The artificial neural network  employed in this work  is a 
multilayer feedforward neural network  [14,  151 as shown 
in Fig. 2.

The nodes in the input layer receive input signals from 
the  outside  world  and  directly  pass  the  signals  to  the 
nodes  in  the next  layer.  In  this  paper,  the  loads  of  the 
laterals  within  the  out-of-service  area  and  the  spare 
capacity of  the supporting feeder are taken  as the inputs 
to the ANN. Details on ANN inputs will be provided at 
the end of  this section. 

The  nodes  in  the  output  layer  provide  us  with  the 
on/off  states  of  the  feeder  tie  switch  and  lateral  tie 
switches. These switch states indicate the set of  switches 
that  must  be  operated  in  the  restoration  plan  as  these 
switches are open in normal  operation. A closed state for 
a  feeder tie  switch indicates  that  we  need  to restore  the 
electricity service using the supporting  feeder by  closing 
the feeder tie switch. On the other hand, a closed state for 
a  lateral  tie  switch reveals that  the  lateral  must  be sup- 
plied  power  from  its  supporting  lateral.  Take  the  dis- 
tribution  system in  Fig.  1 as an example;  we  must  close 
tie switch SW1 and open switch SWlO if  the output state 
for  the lateral  tie  switch SWl is closed. In  other  words, 
lateral  LATl  is  now  restored  by  its  supporting  lateral 
LAT13.  In  this  way,  the  final  restoration  plan 
is 
described  by  the  on-off  states  of  the  feeder  tie  switch 
SW9  and  lateral  tie  switches  SWl,  SW2,  SW3,  SW4, 
SW5,  SW6,  SW7  and  SW8.  These  on-off  states  of  tie 
switches are generated by the nodes in the output layer of 
the ANN.  Details on  ANN  outputs  will  be  given at the 
end of this section. 

In addition to the input layer and the output layer, we 
need one or more hidden layers in between. The nodes in 
the  hidden  layer  take  signals from  the  input  layer  and 
send  their  outputs  to the  nodes  in  the  next  layer  when 
computations within the nodes have been completed.

described as follows. 

divided into three groups. 

1.  The  laterals  within  the  out-of-service  area  are 

The  connection  weights  K j  between  neurons  are 
determined using a set of  training patterns.  A generalised 
delta  rule  [14]  is  employed  to  update  the  connection 
weights.  Details  on  the  determination  of  connection 
weights can be found in Reference 14. 

Details  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  ANN  are 

Group A :  the laterals that can be completely resto- 

red by their corresponding supporting laterals. 

Group B :  the laterals that cannot  be completely res- 

tored by their corresponding supporting laterals. 

Group C:  the laterals which are not connected with 

any supporting laterals via lateral tie switches. 

The laterals in group C are excluded from the inputs and 
outputs of the ANN since these laterals are not equipped 
with  supporting laterals and can only be restored  by  the 
supporting feeder. 

2.  Assume  that  there  are  M  group  A  laterals  and 
(N-M-1)  group B laterals in the out-of-service area for a 
particular  training  pattern. The lateral  loadings and sup- 
porting  feeder capacity  margin  can  be  described  by  the 
vector 

,..., JN-l\IN]T 

L=[I, ,..., J,MII,+, 

(1) 
where  I,,  .. ., I,  = loads  for  group A laterals,  IY+,, . . ., 
IN-,  = loads for group B  laterals,  and I,  = the  capacity 
margin  of  the  supporting  feeder  minus  the  sum  of  the 
loads for group C laterals. 

Since the loads for group B laterals can only be resto- 
red  by  the  supporting  feeder, it  is  more  appropriate  to 
update the vector L to the new vector L: as follows. 

c = [I;, ..., r,  j  I,,,, 

..., r,-,

where  1; = Ii for  i  = 1,  . . ., M ,  I;  = 0 for  i  = M + 1,  . .. , 
N  - 1, and I,  = IN - (1,+,  + 
It is noted that, in eqn. 2, the loads on group B laterals 
have been restored by the supporting feeder. The result is 
a  supporting  feeder  with  less  capacity  margin  for  the 
group A laterals.

+ ... + I,-,). 

3. The vector  L:  in eqn. 2 may not  be directly used as 
the input vector of the ANN since the elements in vector 
L'  may  fall  outside  the  allowable  range  for  the  input 
signals. For  the  multilayer  feedforward  ANN  in  Fig.  2, 
both  the inputs  and outputs are limited to real numbers 
between zero and one. In practice, a range from 0.1 to 0.9 
is normally  recommended  in the  ANN  literature. There- 
fore, the elements of  the vector L are normalised accord- 
ing  to  the  following equation  to  make  them  fall  within 
the range from 0.1 to 0.9: 
x = [XI,  x2, . . . , XN]T 
xi = 0.8( *) 1'. - rmim + 0.1 
(4) 
tax and rmin are the maximum value and minimum value 
of  I; (i = 1,  2, . . . , N). The resultant  vector X is employed 
as  the  input  vector  of  the  ANN.  Note  that  the  above- 
mentioned  normalisation  procedures  apply  equally  well 
to both training patterns and test patterns. 

4.  In  the  training  phase,  the  outputs of  the  ANN  for

the training patterns are defined as follows. 

(5) 

253 

where yi = 0.1 if  the lateral tie switch for lateral i is open, 
yi = 0.9  if  the  lateral  tie  switch  for  lateral  i  is  closed, 
i = 1, 2, . . . , N - 1; and y,  = 0.1  if  the feeder tie switch is 
open, yN = 0.9 if the feeder tie switch is closed. 
5. In the testing phase, the outputs of the ANN will be 
real  numbers  ranging  from  0  to  1. Since these  outputs 
must  provide  information  on the states of  the lateral  tie 
switches and feeder tie switch and there are only two pos- 
sible states (ON/OFF) for each  switch, it is necessary to 
convert  these  real  outputs  to  binary  outputs.  In  the 
present  work,  an iterative  procedure  as described  below 
is developed to do the job. 

Step  1. Set an initial value for the threshold  p. A value 

of  po = 0.7 is chosen. 

Step 2.  If  an output is greater than or equal to p,  set 
the  output to be  1, which means that  the corresponding 
switch must  be closed. Otherwise, set the output to be 0 
and keep the corresponding switch open. 

Step 3. Check if  any feeder or lateral is overloaded. If 
the answer is yes, decrease the value of p  and go back  to 
Step 2. Otherwise, stop and print out results. 

It is noted that the required number of switching oper- 
ations  will  be  increased  if  we  decrease  the  threshold  p. 
This is an undesirable  situation  as mentioned  in  Section 
2.  Therefore, we  prefer  to use a  high  threshold  unless a 
feeder or lateral is overloaded  due to insufficient number 
of  switching operations. 

The pattern recognition approach 

4 
In  this  section, we  try  to apply  the  pattern  recognition 
approach  [19-231 
to  reach  a  proper  restoration  plan. 
The  pattern  recognition  approach involves three  major 
steps. 

Step I .  Create training patterns. 
Step 2. Store the training patterns in the database. 
Step 3. Retrieve the patterns in the database which are 

similar to the pattern under study. 
Details of  the three steps are described as follows. 

4.1  Create training patterns 
A training pattern can be described as follows: 

training pattern 

= (fault location, load, restoration  plan) 

(6) 

4.2  Store the training patterns in the database 
Take  the  distribution  feeder  SM64  in  Fig.  1  as  an 
example, a  training  pattern  in  its  original  form  may  be 
expressed as 

T = [section j  LOAD,, LOAD,, . . ., LOADl2, LM,, 
LM,,  ..., LM,,,  FM I SI, s,, ...) SI,, SF]T 

(7) 

where 

ing lateral for lateral LAT 

section = fault location 
LOADi (i = 1, . . . , 12) = total load of lateral LAT 
LM, (i = 1, . . . , 12) = capacity  margin  of  the support- 
FM = capacity  margin  of  the  supporting  feeder  for 
feeder SM64 
Si (i = 1, . . . , 12) = on/off states of  the lateral tie switch 
for lateral  LAT  (Si = 1 if  the  switch is  closed;  Si = 0 if 
the switch is open) 

S,  = on/off states of  the feeder tie switch (S, = 1 if  the 

switch is closed; SF = 0 if the switch is open) 

254 

4.3  Retrieve the patterns in the database which are 

similar to the pattern under study 

After  the  database  has  been  built,  we  proceed  to deter- 
mine a proper restoration plan for a given pattern. 

Example 

5 
To demonstrate  the  effectiveness of  the  proposed  ANN 
approach,  service  restoration  on  a  distribution  system 
within  the  service area  of  Taipei  City  District  Ofice  of 
Taiwan Power Company is investigated. 

As shown in Fig.  1, the fault at point  A is isolated by 
tripping  circuit  breaker  CB1 and  opening  the switch  at 
branching point 7. 

It is observed from  Fig.  1 that there  ae  12 laterals  to 
be restored electricity service. Among these, the eight lat- 
erals  LAT1-LATB  are  connected  with  their  supporting 
laterals through  lateral tie switches. The feeder names for 
these supporting laterals are shown in Fig. 1. 

In the training process, a total of  240 training patterns 
covering  a  wide  range  of  lateral  loadings  and  capacity 
margins  of  supporting  feeders and laterals  are compiled. 
As for the structure of  the ANN, two hidden layers with 
21 hidden units at each layer are used. In the training of 
the ANN, the learning rate q  and momentum constant  ci 
are fixed at  1.0 and 0.5,  respectively. In  the  experiment, 
we  tried  to use an ANN with  a  single hidden  layer, but 
we  were unable  to obtain satisfactory results even when 
the number of neurons was increased to 42. 

In  the  training  process,  the  connection  weights  are 
updated  each  time a  training  pattern  is  presented.  After 
the 240 patterns in the training set have all been present- 
ed  once,  one  iteration  of  training  is  completed.  At  this 
time, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of  the present 
iteration is computed as follows: 

where  O i , j  and  Oi,jac,un, are  the  ANN  output  and  the 
actual value of  thejth neuron for the ith training pattern. 
After  the  RMSE for  the  present  iteration  is determined, 
the 240 patterns are again presented in the next iteration. 
The process is repeated  until  the  RMSE for an iteration 
is less than a specified value. In the present  example, the 
error is acceptable after 300 iterations. 

After the  ANN has  been trained  using  the  set of  240 
training  patterns  in  the  training  set, it  can  be  employed 
to generate  a  proper  restoration  plan  for  a  given  oper- 
ating condition. To see how  the  ANN  works  in  the test 
cases, results from  a  typical example  are presented. The 
load currents on the feeder to be restored (SM64) and the 
supporting  feeder (SU73) are listed in  Table  1 while the

capacity  margins  of  the  supporting  laterals  are listed  in 
Table  2.  In  the  present  case,  the  seven  laterals  LATl- 
LAT7 are group A laterals since their corresponding sup- 
porting  laterals  are able to restore  completely the  loads 
on these laterals. As for the other laterals, lateral LATB is 
a group B lateral while laterals LAT9-LAT12  are group

as follows. 

L = 18,  16, 18, 7, 32, 50,47 \  60 \  1941' 

From eqn. 2, the updated vector C is as follows: 

C = [8,  16, 18, 7, 32, 50,47 \  0 j  1341' 

Therefore, the input  vector X can be obtained from eqn. 
3 as 

X = C0.148, 0.196, 0.208, 0.142, 

These  real-valued  outputs are  then  converted  to  binary 
values using the procedures  of Section 3. With  a thresh-

ANN approach and the pattern recognition approach are 
described. The  effectiveness of  the  proposed  approaches 
is demonstrated by service restoration of an underground 
distribution system within the service area of  Taipei City 
District  Office  of  Taiwan  Power  Company.  It  is  con- 
cluded from  the results  that  proper  restoration  plan  can 
be  reached by  the proposed  ANN  approach  and pattern 
recognition method in a very efficient manner. 

Just as the heuristic search method of  Reference 5, the 
ANN  approach  gives  a  single restoration  plan.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  pattern  recognition  approach  yields 
several  restoration  plans  in  the  order  of  increasing 
number of  switching operations. 

The training phase of  the ANN approach  and pattern 
recognition  method  requires some time.  In addition, the 
training of  the neural networks must be repeated, and the 
database  for  the  pattern  recognition  method  must  be 
updated  any  time  there  is  a  change  in  system configu- 
ration.  Fortunately,  neural  network  training  and  data- 
base  updating  are  usually  carried  out  offiine, therefore 
time is not a crucial factor at the training stage. After the 
ANN  has  been  trained  and  the  training  patterns  have 
been stored in the pattern recognition method, it requires 
only a very short period to obtain the desired restoration 
plan  using  the  two  approaches  since only  simple calcu- 
lations are involved in reaching the solutions. 

In the underground distribution  system of  Taipei, any 
feeder is  connected  with  a  supporting  feeder  via  a  nor- 
mally open tie switch. The two feeders constitute a feeder 
pair which can be regarded as a unit. We need a separate 
ANN  for  each  distribution  feeder.  As  for  the  pattern 
recognition  approach,  a separate database  is created  for 
each  distribution  feeder. Therefore,  the  efficiency of  the 
two approaches is independent  of  the size of  the distribu- 
tion system. In a distribution  system with three-terminal 
or four-terminal feeders, an ANN must be established for 
the group of feeders which are connected together. In this 
case, the size of  the ANN  or the database in the pattern 
recognition method will be somewhat larger than that of 
the ANN or the database used in this current work. 

Up  to  now,  substation  automation  has  been  com- 
pleted  for  all  substations  in  the  metropolitan  area  of 
Taipei. All  substations  in  Taiwan  will  be  automated  in 
five years.  The switches in  an automated  substation can 
be operated in a remote control mode by the operators at 
the distribution  dispatch  and control centre.  Meanwhile, 
a feeder automation  project has been initiated by Taiwan 
Power Company  at three district  offices and is expected 
to be completed in the near future. By the time the feeder 
automation project  is completed, the switches on feeders 
will also be  operated by remote control by the operators 
at the distribution dispatch and control centre. Therefore, 
for a distribution system with automated  substations and 
feeders, the operators can change the on/off statues of the 
switches  in  a  very  short  time.  In  this  case,  a  decision 
period  of  two  minutes  seems to be  a  long  time  for  the 
operators  to wait  before they  or the  computer  can  take 
actions  to restore  the  electricity supply.  Employment  of 
the  ANN method  and  the pattern  recognition  approach 
as an effort to reduce this computational time. 

In  the  example,  the  load  pattern  used  as  the  test 
pattern  does not  belong to the training set for the ANN 
method  and  the  pattern  recognition  approach.  It  is 
observed from the results in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 
that  both  the  ANN  and the pattern  recognition  method 
can still yield  proper restoration plans which are close to 
that  achieved  by  the  heuristic  search  method.  It  seems 
that the ANN is capable  of  generating solutions for new 

untrained  patterns  through  some  kind  of  ‘interpolation’ 
procedure.
